Your readme.md file should include an app overview (assessing LO1 and LO3) (up to 300
words):
<br>
• Developer name (for this, use your name and ID number) <br>
• App title. <br>
• One line, promo text summary of your app. <br>
• List of app functionalities your users will experience in your app. These should relate <br>

<br>
The readme.md file should also include details of the app design (assessing LO1 and LO3)
(up to 500 words) including: <br>
• A wireframe or screenshot of each page, describing the widgets used to display and
receive information to/from the user and why, and the layout managers used to
arrange them. <br>
• Details of how the functionalities are implemented in each page, for example: <br>
o How users navigate through the app. This can be a screenshot of the
navigation graph visualisation, with appropriate description. <br>
o Which lifecycle events each page will respond to and how. <br>
o Which web service your app uses and how, including details of the data to be
sent/received to/from it. <br>
o The structure of data stored in the Room SQLite database. <br>
o Any mobile specific functionalities that have been implemented. <br>

<br>
Reflective Statement
The readme.md file should also include a reflective statement (assessing LO2) (up to 500
words).<br>
Having completed your implementation, you should reflect on the experience. This should
consider details of the tools used and your experience of them, examples of how code
samples from third parties (e.g. generative AI, StackOverflow) were used and the challenges
encountered with their use, what was successful about the project, what could have gone
better, and any lessons you learnt that will be useful for future development projects
